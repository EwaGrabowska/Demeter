# Project: Demeter

## Overview
Our project aims to revolutionize the culinary world by leveraging artificial intelligence to design, enhance, and create innovative variations of known dishes. We like to use the AI's ability to analyze and combine data from different cuisines and ingredients allows it to suggest dishes that blend various flavors in innovative ways. The application will analyze individual preferences, cultural differences, and various factors such as mood, time of day, and season to recommend dishes. Utilizing a comprehensive database of global cuisine, the application will combine flavors and structures in ways unimaginable by a single person. This integration of AI and neurogastronomy will enhance both the nutritional value and sensory pleasure of food, pushing the boundaries of culinary creativity.

## Key Features
- **Recipe Design and Enhancement**: Using AI to introduce variations and improvements to traditional recipes.
- **Flavor and Texture Analysis**: Creating surprising combinations by analyzing proportions, flavors, and textures.
- **Individual and Cultural Preferences**: Tailoring recommendations based on personal and cultural dietary habits.
- **Mood and Seasonal Adjustments**: Adapting dish suggestions based on mood, time of day, and seasonal ingredients.
- **Advanced Cooking Techniques**: Incorporating methods such as sous vide to achieve perfect flavor and texture.
- **Health and Ecology**: Promoting ecological and healthy products by perfecting their taste to encourage adoption.
- **Neurogastronomy Integration**: Applying the latest research from neurogastronomy to enhance the sensory experience of food.

## Research and References
Our application is built upon cutting-edge research in various fields including neurogastronomy, AI-enabled kitchens, and consumer preference studies. Key sources include:

## Integration with IBM Watson's Chef Watson
Our project expands on the foundation laid by IBM Watson's Chef Watson, which has demonstrated the powerful potential of AI in creating innovative and unexpected food pairings. Chef Watson, developed in collaboration with the Institute of Culinary Education (ICE), uses cognitive computing to analyze vast amounts of data on recipes, food pairings, and the chemical compounds in ingredients to suggest novel combinations. This process enables the AI to recommend ingredient combinations that are both surprising and harmonious, pushing chefs to explore beyond their usual comfort zones and expand their culinary creativity.

Chef Watson's impact goes beyond creating new dishes; it serves as a tool for chefs to enhance their skills and creativity by offering ingredient combinations they might not have previously considered. This can be particularly beneficial for addressing specific dietary needs, sustainability issues, and even creating solutions to larger problems like world hunger by developing recipes that use more accessible and sustainable ingredients.

## Future Directions
- **Predictive Analytics**: Utilizing AI-driven predictive analytics to optimize ingredient inventory and minimize waste.
- **Automated Cooking Equipment**: Enhancing food quality and preparation speed through automated cooking technologies.
- **Personalized Customer Experience**: Using self-service kiosks to personalize dining experiences based on real-time data.
